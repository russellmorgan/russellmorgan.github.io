## Front end developer can mean a lot of things these days.

In my case it's a focus on layout, styling and functionality. I have a deep respect for the disciplines of design and UX and enjoy bringing their work to life. I take great care in crafting responsive layouts and creating engaging interactivity that works across all platforms.

To sum up, I speak design and tech with equal fluency. This duality allows me to be creative, problem solve and contribute in unique and positive ways to a project.

I've worked at digital agencies, startups and other companies. I've also worked along side some truly amazing developers. I'm comfortable as the sole technical resource or as part of a team, both offsite and on.

When I'm not being a front end developer I love 3D technology, photography, working with game engines and experimenting with VR and AR.
