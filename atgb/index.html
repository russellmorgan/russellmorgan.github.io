            <h1>Your life in months</h1>
            <p>Enter in your birthdate to visualize how many months of your life have gone by and how many you have left if you live to 90 years of age.</p>
            <p>This project is based on a wait but why article that I encourage you to <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html" target="_new">read</a>. I hope this (or the article) will help you make the best of the time you have. As you will see in a moment, life is kind of short so go for quality! ;-)</p>
