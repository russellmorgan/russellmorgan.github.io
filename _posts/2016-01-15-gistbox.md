Gistbox is a really nice extension for Chrome that allows you to view, add, edit and search any of your Github gists. I've only had it for a short while but I can already tell this is going to save me a lot of time. I'm planning on making a public Gist for the flexbox posts I've been working on.

Well worth a [visit](http://www.gistboxapp.com/) to the author's site with a nice video description of how it works.
