                        "Front end developer" means different things to different people.

                        <p>For me it's a focus on layout and styling. I have a deep respect for design and UX and enjoy bringing their hard work to life. I take great care in crafting semantic html and I love grids, flexbox and css methodologies like nobody's business.</p>

                        <P>That said I'm also comfortable writing code, implementing frameworks and working with a variety of platforms. To sum up, I speak design and tech with equal fluency. This duality allows me to be creative, problem solve and contribute in unique and positive way to a project.</P>

                        <p>I've been fortunate enough to work with agencies, startups, and companies along with many talented people who have all helped make me become the developer I am today. I've also worked as a sole technical resource and as part of a team, both offsite and on. I'm sometimes asked if I have a work preference, I don't. The variety has been a great learning experience.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not being a front end developer I love 3D modeling, photography, working with game engines and experimenting with VR and AR.</p>

                        The following is a list of skills and technologies I've worked with. Given my focus on layout I don't claim to be an expert on many of these but I'm knowledgeable and comfortable enough to include them. I use VS Code as my editor of choice.
