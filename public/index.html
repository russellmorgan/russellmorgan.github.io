                        <h3>"Front end developer" can mean a lot of things.</h3>

                        <p>For me it's a focus on layout and styling. I have a deep respect for design and UX and enjoy
                            bringing their hard work to life. I take great care in crafting semantic html and I love
                            grids, flexbox and css methodologies like nobody's business.</p>

                        <P>That said I'm also comfortable writing code, implementing frameworks and working with a
                            variety of platforms. To sum up, I speak design and tech with equal fluency. This duality
                            allows me to be creative, problem solve and contribute in unique and positive way to a
                            project.</P>

                        <p>I've been fortunate enough to work with agencies, startups, and companies along with many
                            talented people who have all helped make me become the developer I am today. I've also
                            worked as a sole technical resource and as part of a team, both offsite and on. I'm
                            sometimes asked if I have a work preference, I don't. The variety has been a great learning
                            experience.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not being a front end developer I love 3D modeling, photography, working with game
                            engines and experimenting with VR and AR.</p>

                    <div>
                        The following is a list of skills and technologies I've worked with. Given my focus on layout I
                        don't claim mastery but I'm knowledgeable and comfortable enough to include them. I also use
                        VSCode as my editor, it's really good!

                    <div>I hate to start with an excuse but my portfolio requires a little bit of an explanation...
                        <p>I've been working as a full time contractor for the past few years on some very large
                            projects for <a href="https://www.isobar.com/us/en/" target="_new">Isobar</a> that I can't
                            show off. (due to a combination of B2B and NDA). These were fantastic projects where I got
                            to work with really talented front end developers and get my feet wet with technologies
                            like ReactJS. Unfortunately that didn't leave a lot of time for personal projects or other
                            clients.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>That said, I've pulled together a few projects I've been involved with and I'm currently hard
                        at work behind the scenes building some new things to add to here soon. Mostly I'm looking
                        forward to being able to remove this mea culpa as soon as possible.</div>
