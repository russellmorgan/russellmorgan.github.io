	  	<p>The Concept Farm is an advertising agency based in NYC.
	  	I was contracted to replace their existing Flash based site with a responsive html5 version.</p>
	  	<p>The site is run by Wordpress with customized post types for easy updating of content.</p>

	  <h4>Rotary Club</h4>
	  <div class="details">
	  	<p>I was asked by Siegel & Gale to implement a parallax background effect for the Rotary Club homepage</p>
	  	Using the stellar.js jquery plugin I was able to revise the existing HTML and work with the design team to tweak the amount of parallax for each element until the site had exactly the right balance of readability and animation.</p>

  	  	<p>This is a mobile game for iphone. Arguably an "improved" version of Flappy Bird I wanted to challenge myself to see how quickly I could implement a game everyone was talking about.</p>
  	  	<p>Turns out the answer is 3 days. (and about 3 more weeks to iron out the iAd implementation in a way that made Apple happy)</p>
